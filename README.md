#Challenge
The challenge for this video is to create a pokemon classifier by their type 1 (i.e fire, water, grass, etc.) using [this](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon) pokemon dataset on Kaggle. It will be great practice in data preparation (feature selection, cleaning, etc.).

#Demo
run 'Python3 main.py' to run both of the classifiers.

#Result
I've created two classifiers, Gaussian Naive Bayes and KNN. On average the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier performs better than KNN. The average accuracy of the Gaussian NB classifier lies around 14%.

#Conclusion
After reading [this](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/d/abcsds/pokemon/classifying-pokemon-type-by-stat-allocation)
and failing to classify with a decent accuracy, I'd like to conclude that there is most likely
no relationship between the choosen features and the type. If there is, then I made some
mistake, which this would be a mayor learning point for me :).
